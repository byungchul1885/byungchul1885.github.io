## .and_then

.and_then() is a helpful method that takes an Option, then lets you do something to its value and pass it on. So its input is an Option, and its output is also an Option. It is sort of like a safe "unwrap, then do something, then wrap again".

```rust
fn main() {
    let new_vec = vec![8, 9, 0];
    let number_to_add = 5;
    let mut empty_vec = vec![];

    for index in 0..5 {
        empty_vec.push(
            new_vec
               .get(index)
               .and_then(|number| Some(number + 1))
               .and_then(|number| Some(number + number_to_add))
        );
    }
    println!("{:?}", empty_vec);
}
```
