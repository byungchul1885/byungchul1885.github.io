## string s = (string)o

+ Throws <font color='#1E90FF'>__InvalidCastException__</font> if o is not a string
+ Otherwise, assigns o to s, even if o is null

## string s = o as string

+ Assigns null to s if o is not a string or if o is null
+ For this reason, you cannot use it with value types (the operator could never return null in that case)
+ Otherwise, assigns o to s
+ same as below code

```cs
if(o is string) 
    s = o;
else
    s = null;
```
