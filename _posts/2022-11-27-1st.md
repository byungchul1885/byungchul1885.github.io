## channel에 대하여

- A channel is a data structure that allows one thread to communicate with another thread
- In .NET, this was usually done by using a shared variable that supports concurrency (by implementing some synchronization/locking mechanism)
- Channels, on the other hand, can be used to send messages directly between threads without any external synchronization or locking required
These messages are sent in FIFO (first in first out) order

```c#

/* creates a channel with an unlimited capacity */
private readonly Channel<string> ch = Channel.CreateUnbounded<string>();

/* creates a channel with a finite capacity
    Channel<string> ch = Channel.CreateBounded<string>(10); */

private async void Button7_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    while (await ch.Reader.WaitToReadAsync())
    {
        var inStr = await ch.Reader.ReadAsync();
        Debug.WriteLine($"{inStr}");                
    }

    Debug.WriteLine($"channel closed");
}

private async void Button8_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    var rnd = new Random();
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        var delay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(rnd.Next(3));
        Debug.WriteLine($"delay {delay}");

        await Task.Delay(delay);
        await ch.Writer.WriteAsync($"Message {i}");

        /* try to write synchronously. 
            * It will return false if the write fails, which should 
            * not happen for an unbounded channel
            * 
            * bool result = ch.Writer.TryWrite("New message"); */
    }

    /* 아래 코드를 수행하면 ch.Reader.WaitToReadAsync()가 false를
        * 리턴한다. 채널이 닫힌다
        * 
        * ch.Writer.Complete(); */
}

```
